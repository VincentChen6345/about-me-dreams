              <h1>High School - early 2010s</h1>
              <p>
                When I was a kid in high school my dream was to become a
                full-time Youtuber. I was inspired by Asian American Youtubers
                like NigaHiga and KevJumba.

                My dream was to be a pro-singer, the next Bruno Mars. I watched
                a Chinese TV show called 'The Voice of China' and I was very
                inspired by their skill and technique.
                <br /><br />
                Then I learned about voice types and since I'm not a male tenor,
                I wasn't born with a high pop voice. It's the equivalent of
                trying to be a pro NBA player when I'm 5'8. That was the end of
                my singer dream.

                Unfortunately I ended up in an industry that I didn't feel
                passionate about. All I could dream about was infact becoming a
                self-taught front-end developer. I learned off Udemy courses in
                my spare time and built some projects.
                <br /><br />
                I was committed... and then it was 2023...and then ChatGPT came
                out...and then there were tech layoffs. Fear and doubt got the
                better of me and I decided to stop coding in 2023.

                Here is my personal portfolio that I created during my 'prime' 2

              <p>
                I'm back.
                <br /><br />
                I've taken the leap of faith,resigned from my full-time job and
                returned to pursue my passion for the tech industry. I'm
                studying a Masters of IT specialising in cybersecurity. However,
                web dev will always have a special place in my heart. That's why
                I'd love to join this program!
                <br /><br />
                I don't know what the future holds but if I stay true to myself
                and keep moving forward eventually, I will find my own 'one
                piece'.
