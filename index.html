             <h1>High School - early 2010s</h1>
            <p>
                When I was a kid in high school my dream was to become a full-time Youtuber. I was inspired by Asian American Youtubers like NigaHiga and KevJumba.

             My dream was to be a pro-singer. The next Bruno Mars. I had watched a Chinese TV show called 'The Voice of China' and I was very inspired by their skill and technique.

            <p>
                Unfortunately I ended up in an industry that I didn't feel passionate about. All I could dream about was infact, becoming a self-taught front-end develoer. I learned off Udemy courses in my spare time, built some projects. 
                <br><br>
                I was committed... and then it was 2023...and then ChatGPT came out...and then there were tech layoffs. Fear and doubt got the better of me and I decided to stop coding in 2023.

                Here is my personal portfolio that I created during my 'prime' 2 years ago ðŸ˜­.

             <h1>Returning to uni - 2025</h1>
            <p>
                I'm back.
                <br><br>
                I took the plunge and returned to pursue my passion for the tech industry. I'm studying a Masters of IT specialising in cybersecurity. However, web dev will always have a special in my heart. 
                <br><br>
                I don't know what the future holds, but if I stay true to myself and keep moving forward, eventually I will find my own 'one piece'.
